seedlingsRecruitmentAnalysis
============================

Set of functions for Solarik et al. 2007 paper. It is a R package to
share efficiently the code we used which remains quite specific to the
kind of dataset we use. However as the kernel are more general and could
be used in many context, we put them in a different package available
[here](https://github.com/KevCaz/recruitR).

Function's names are written using Camel case (*e.g.* `formatData()`).
