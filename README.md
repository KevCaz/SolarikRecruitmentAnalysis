seedlingsRecruitmentAnalysis
============================

This is not really a R package in the common sense. It is rather the set
of functions we used for Solarik et al. 2007 paper. The form of a is
quite convenient to share efficiently our code, which however remains
quite specific to the kind of datasets we used. Nevertheless, as the
kernels are more general and could be used in another studies, they were
put in a separate package available
[here](https://github.com/KevCaz/recruitR). The whole analysis we
undertook is described in the package's vignette.

Details
=======

Function's names are written using Camel case (*e.g.* `formatData()`).

To do
-----

-   \[ \] Vignette is about 35% complete.
-   \[ \] Improve the code coverage
-   \[ \] Adding Links to the paper and the datasets once they are
    published.
