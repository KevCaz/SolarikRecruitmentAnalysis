seedlingsRecruitmentAnalysis
============================

This repository includes all the R functions to reproduce the analyses
we carry out in Solarik *et al.* XXXX. The form of a standard R package
is convenient to share code and ensure Operating System (OS)
interoperability. Moreover this repository is an appropriate platform to
discuss and handle potential code issues.

Note that in the analysis presented, we use a Rcpp implementation of
dispersal kernel available as a separate package
([recruitR](https://github.com/KevCaz/recruitR)) that therefore needs to
be installed.

The whole analysis we undertook is described in the packageâ€™s vignette
and accessible as a
[webpage](https://kevcaz.github.io/seedlingsRecruitmentAnalysis/).

Notes: 1. Functions of package names are written using Camel case
(*e.g.* `formatData()`).

How to use the package
----------------------

A couple of Github package are required. The easiest way to install
them, is to use of the `devtools` package available on CRAN using the
`install.packages()` function:

``` r
install.packages('devtools')
```

Once loaded, `install_guthub()` eases the installation of the other
packages:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github(c('KevCaz/recruitR', 'inSileco/letiRmisc', 'inSileco/graphicsUtils'))
```

including this package:

``` r
install_github('KevCaz/seedlingsRecruitmentAnalysis')
```

To do
-----

-   \[ \] Include data as `.rda` files
-   \[ \] Complete vignette (~40% complete) up to provide an example for
    on line of `simuDesign`
-   \[ \] Turn Solarik.Rmd as a real vignette
-   \[ \] Adding links to the paper and the datasets once published.
