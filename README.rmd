# seedlingsRecruitmentAnalysis

Ths repository includes all the R functions to reproduce the analyses we
carry out in Solarik *et al.* XXXX. The form of a standard R package is
convenient to share code aand ensure Operating System (OS interoperability.
Moreover this repository is dedicated for discuss and handle potential code issues
an user may have.

In this package we use a Rcpp implementation of dispersal kernel available as
a separate package ([recruitR](https://github.com/KevCaz/recruitR)).
The whole analysis we undertook is described in the package's vignette.

Notes:
  1. Function's names are written using Camel case (*e.g.* `formatData()`).
